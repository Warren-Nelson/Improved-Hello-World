# My Very First Project

A simple web page displaying the famous "Hello, World" both in the console and on the page itself.

It also includes a dark and light mode that can be toggled with a button labeled: "Change the theme!".

Even though I’m a beginner in the world of programming, I still tried to style my web page — maybe in my own way, but at least I can proudly say I did it!
